# Big-Data-Cloud-Computing

🚀 Big Data Cloud Computing Project
This repository contains resources, code, and examples focused on Big Data processing and cloud integration using Apache Spark (PySpark) and AWS services like EC2, S3, and SNS.

🧠 Technologies & Concepts Covered
⚙️ PySpark
Working with RDDs and DataFrames

Applying filter() transformation to filter records

Using n (limit) to select top records

Spark session setup and data loading

☁️ AWS Services
EC2: For deploying Spark clusters or running PySpark jobs on cloud-based virtual machines

S3: Reading from and writing to AWS S3 buckets using PySpark

SNS (Simple Notification Service): Sending notifications based on Spark job events or pipeline triggers

🔍 PySpark Examples
python
Copy code
# Filtering data in PySpark
df_filtered = df.filter(df['age'] > 30)

# Getting top n rows
df.show(n=5)
☁️ AWS Integration
EC2:

Launch EC2 instance with Spark pre-installed (Amazon Linux or Ubuntu)

SSH into EC2 and run PySpark jobs

S3:

python
Copy code
df = spark.read.csv("s3a://your-bucket-name/data.csv")
df.write.parquet("s3a://your-bucket-name/output/")
SNS:

Send notifications after job completion

Use Boto3 to integrate with AWS SNS in Python

🔧 Setup Instructions
Create a virtual environment

Install dependencies

Set up AWS credentials

Run PySpark job locally or on EC2
